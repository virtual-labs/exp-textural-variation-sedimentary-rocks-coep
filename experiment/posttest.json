      "question": "Detrital rocks refer to which type of sedimentary rocks?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Mechanically formed",
        "b": "Organically formed",
        "c": "Chemically formed",
        "d": "Residual"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Explanation :During the formation of the sedimentary rocks by a mechanical method, original hard and coherent rock bodies are gradually broken down into smaller fragments. This disintegrated, loosened material is called detritus. Hence, clastic rocks are often also called as detrital rocks.",
        "b": "Explanation ",
        "c": "Explanation ",
        "d": "Explanation "

        "a": "Explanation",
        "b": "Explanation ",
        "c": "Explanation :The most important phenomenon that happens to the sediments during their transport and deposition is sorting or grading according to their size, shape and density.",

        "c": "High pressure and low temperature",
        "d": "High pressure and high temperature"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Explanation :The sorting or grading occurs during the deposition stage of the formation of sedimentary rocks and the deposition happens in layers in most cases. Deposition generally takes place under ordinary pressure and temperature conditions.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Explanation ",
        "b": "Explanation :By stratification is understood a layered arrangement in sedimentary rock. This may be developed very prominently and can be seen from a distance of miles or in other cases may have to be ascertained after close examination of the rock.",
